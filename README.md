## GROUP KEY AGREEMENT PROTOCOL ##
This project is an implementation of a group key agreement protocol for nodes on a smart grid.
This code uses the correlation between the data observed by different nodes to generate a secret key using a spanning tree.
In particular, the PIN model referenced in this [paper](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~htyagi/papers/tksv12.pdf) is implemented with modifications
